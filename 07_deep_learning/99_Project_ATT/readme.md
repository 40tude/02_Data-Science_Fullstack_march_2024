* The specs of the project are here : https://app.jedha.co/course/projects-deep-learning-ft/att-spam-detector-ft


## Read the .pptx first
* Everything is in the title... We can't do it for you

* The idea is that the slides should help you understand the project and its results, guiding you step by step
