# Conversion rate challenge readme
* The specs of the project are here : https://app.jedha.co/course/projects-supervised-machine-learning-ft/conversion-rate-challenge-ft

## Read the .pptx first
* Everything is in the title... We can't do it for you
* The content of the slides is mainly a cut-and-paste of what's available in the project notebook(s) and other files
* The idea is that the slides should help you understand the project and its results, guiding you step by step

## How to use the project ?

* Make sure to read the slides ``conversion_rate_challenge.pptx`` first
* There are 3 notebooks
    * ``02_conversion_rate_challenge_eda.ipynb`` focus on the EDA
    * ``03_conversion_rate_challenge_baseline.ipynb`` is an implementation of a baseline model. Including performance analysis, features importance display and logistic regression threshold adjustment
    * ``04_conversion_rate_challenge_framework.ipynb`` is a framework which helps to select the best parameters and to compare models
