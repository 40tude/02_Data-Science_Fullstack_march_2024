# Conversion rate challenge readme
* The specs of the project are here : https://app.jedha.co/course/projects-supervised-machine-learning-ft/conversion-rate-challenge-ft

## Read the .pptx first
* Everything is in the title... We can't do it for you
* The content of the slides is mainly a cut-and-paste of what's available in the project notebook(s) and other files
* The idea is that the slides should help you understand the project and its results, guiding you step by step

## Files of the project

└───assets
        csv, png files...
```

``assets`` : This directory include some screen captures, backup, preliminary testing... If needed this is where the notebook read the dataset, store the log files, save some ``.json`` or ``.csv`` files...


## How to use the project ?

* Make sure to read the slides ``conversion_rate_challenge.pptx`` first
* There are 3 notebooks
    * ``02_conversion_rate_challenge_eda.ipynb`` focus on the EDA
    * ``03_conversion_rate_challenge_baseline.ipynb`` is an implementation of a baseline model. Including performance analysis, features importance display and logistic regression threshold adjustment
    * ``04_conversion_rate_challenge_framework.ipynb`` is a framework which helps to select the best parameters and to compare models 
    * Most of the <span style="color:orange"><b>Comments </b></span> cells are NOT about the code but about the results, the data and ideas we want to share etc.
