# Walmart project readme
* The specs of the project are here : https://app.jedha.co/course/projects-supervised-machine-learning-ft/walmart-sales-ft


## Read the .pptx first
* Everything is in the title... We can't do it for you
* The content of the slides is mainly a cut-and-paste of what's available in the project notebook(s) and other files
* The idea is that the slides should help you understand the project and its results, guiding you step by step

## Files of the project 

## How to use the project ?


* Read the slides ``walmart_project.pptx`` before to jump into the notebook ``00_walmart.ipynb``
* The code should not be that hard
* <span style="color:orange"><b>Comments </b></span> cells are not about the code but about the results, data etc.
