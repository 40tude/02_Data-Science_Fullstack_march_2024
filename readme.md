# Notes and projects source code from my "Data Science & Engineering - Fullstack" training at JEDHA

* The **Fullstack** training comes after the **Essential** training (JEDHA) and before the **Lead** training (JEDHA)
    * Notes and projects of the **Essential** training are you can find them [here](https://github.com/40tude/Data_Essentials_Stage_Oct_2023) 
    * Notes and projects of the **Lead** training are available [here](https://github.com/40tude/Data_Essentials_Stage_Oct_2023) 
* 12 weeks
* march 18 - june 18 2024
* JEDHA [web page](https://en.jedha.co/formations/formation-data-scientist) of the **Fullstack** training
