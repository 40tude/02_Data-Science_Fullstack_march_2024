# Intro
* The specs of the project are here : https://app.jedha.co/course/project-steam-ft/steam-ft
* There is a copy of the specs in ``steam.ipynb``

# Files organization
* You may want to read the ``steam_project.pptx`` to have a summaryu of the results
* Otherwise, based on the specs, there are 3 notebooks to consider (ideally they should be opened in Databricks)

1. steam_part1.ipynb : Analysis at the "macro" level
    1. Which publisher has released the most games on Steam?
    1. What are the best rated games?
    1. Are there years with more releases? Were there more or fewer game releases during the Covid, for example?
    1. How are the prizes distributed? Are there many games with a discount?
    1. What are the most represented languages?
    1. Are there many games prohibited for children under 16/18?

2. steam_part2.ipynb : Genres analysis
    1. What are the most represented genres?
    1. Are there any genres that have a better positive/negative review ratio?
    1. Do some publishers have favorite genres?
    1. What are the most lucrative genres?

3. steam_part3.ipynb : Platform analysis
    1. Are most games available on Windows/Mac/Linux instead?
    1. Do certain genres tend to be preferentially available on certain platforms?
    1. You're free to follow these guidelines, or to choose a different angle of analysis, as long as your analysis reveals relevant and useful information.

### Side note 
While on Databricks, once a table is on screen, feel free to use the "ordering arrow" at the top of any numerical column in order to display the data in the order that you wish.
