# Speed dating project readme
* The specs of the project are here : https://app.jedha.co/course/project-speed-dating-ft/speed-dating-ft

## Read the .pptx first
* Everything is in the title... We can't do it for you
* The content of the slides is mainly a cut-and-paste of what's available in the project notebook(s) and other files
* The idea is that the slides should help you understand the project and its results, guiding you step by step

## Files of the project

```    

``assets`` : This directory include some screen captures, backup, preliminary testing... If needed this is where the notebook read the dataset, store the log files, save some ``.json`` or ``.csv`` files...

## How to use the project ?
* Once you have read the slides (`01_speed_dating_project.pptx`)
* Open and run ``02_speed_dating.ipynb``
    * Most of the <span style="color:orange"><b>Comments </b></span> cells are NOT about the code but about the results, the data and ideas we want to share etc.
