# North face project readme

* The specs of the project are here : https://app.jedha.co/course/projects-unsupervised-machine-learning-ft/the-north-face-ecommerce-ft

## Read the .pptx first
* Everything is in the title... We can't do it for you
* The content of the slides is mainly a cut-and-paste of what's available in the project notebook(s) and other files
* The idea is that the slides should help you understand the project and its results, guiding you step by step

## How to use the project ?

* Most of the <span style="color:orange"><b>Comments </b></span> cells of the notebooks are NOT about the code but about the results, the data and ideas we want to share etc.
